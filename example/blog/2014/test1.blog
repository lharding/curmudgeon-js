This is a simple blog post. Line 1 is the title, line 2 is the date (gets sorted in lexical order for archive pages,
reverse lexical order for the frontpage), line 3 is reserved, the remainder is the content.
As you can see, the directory structure relative to your `blog/` directory gets mirrored in the output.
